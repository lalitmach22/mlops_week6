# 1. Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# 2. Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# 3. Copy the dependencies file and install them
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# 4. Copy the rest of the application code (main.py and the model)
# The workflow will download model.joblib into this `api` directory before building
COPY . .

# 5. Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8000

# 6. Define the command to run the application
# Use 0.0.0.0 to make it accessible from outside the container
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
